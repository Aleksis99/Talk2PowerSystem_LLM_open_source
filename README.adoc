== Overview

Large-Language Model (LLM) part of Talk2PowerSystem (Talk2PowerSystem_LLM) is a core component of the Talk2PowerSystem project, providing all the necessary coding and scripting to support the integration and operation of a Large-Language Model (LLM). This project focuses on enabling robust LLM functionalities, including data preprocessing, model training, inference, and seamless integration with other parts of the Talk2PowerSystem ecosystem.

== Features

* **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Scripts to clean, normalize, and format data for LLM training.

* **Model Training:**  
  Pipelines and utilities for fine-tuning and training LLM models.

* **Inference Engine:**  
  Code for running real-time queries and generating model predictions.

* **System Integration:**  
  Tools and interfaces to connect the LLM with other components of the Talk2PowerSystem project.

* **Testing and Evaluation:**  
  Automated tests and performance evaluation scripts to ensure model reliability and accuracy.
